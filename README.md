Hey hi ðŸ‘‹ ,

i'm Nirvik, a passionate full stack software engineer with specilization in Android Application Development based in Sydney, Australia. My passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. i take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build. I have a Bachelors degree in IT with a specilization in Application development and I am currently working as an Application Developer at Crossmark Australia (full-time) and doing my Master Of IT in Artificial Intelligence (part-time) at UNSW.

I am also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer. i learned a lot from the open-source community and i love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happens through open-source.
